# Code Editor

Code Editor is a powerful web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js), designed to facilitate code editing within the browser. With support for CRUD operations, users can create, read, update, and delete their code seamlessly. Whether you're writing a quick script or working on a complex project, Code Editor provides a user-friendly interface to manage your code effectively.

## Current Focus:
Currently, I'm addressing date formatting issues and fixing some issues related to the delete functionality.

## Future Updates:
In the next version, users will be able to run lightweight code directly in the web app, greatly enhancing its functionality.

Stay tuned for the installation and usage guide!
